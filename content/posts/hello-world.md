[//]: # (Chapter 1: Saying Hello  )
Is it just me or is there someone here?

The air feels like too thin to breathe.  
Earth, My Earth! It all seems so distant now. Like a tiny speck of dust in the endless canvas of numerous specks.  

My team arrives in two days. Only if my Outer Space Vehicle had not malfunctioned.. I have become a liability to everyone. huh!  

Perhaps its the lack of oxygen talking. I have to conserve oxygen for the near future though I dont think it will run out in the next 10 days  
But as they say, when in space think like a spacer.   
Rather dont think! Follow protocol, you moron. You have trained for this! Deep Space Exploration. This has always been your deepest dream. Reaching out new frontieers in human knowledge.
