[//]: # (Chapter 1: Saying Hello  )
Is it just me or is there someone here?

The air feels like too thin to breathe.  
Earth, My Earth! It all seems so distant now. Like a tiny speck of dust in the endless canvas of numerous specks.   


My team arrives in two days. Only if my Outer Space Vehicle had not malfunctioned.. I have become a liability to everyone. huh!   


Perhaps This is the lack of oxygen talking. I have to conserve oxygen for the near future.   
*You deepest fears! You have enough oxygen in your pack for the next 5 days.*  
But as they say: when in space think like a spacer. Everything that can go wrong, **will** go wrong unless I think it through.  
Mr Quoter.  


*Duster has always felt a deep connection juggling with words. A quote here. A line from the peom there. 
His mates used to call him Duster Wordsworth. Jakiro, his mate from the bunk at Inner Solar Space Station called him DW Longfellow*  
Ahh! Those days of soulful oblivion. Youth always has its charms play out while time is at play sapping out possibilies from the walks of life   
Or was It Time adding more possibiities with each tick of the hand. I had never been sure of this  


*A voice mumbes from beyond the recess*      
Rather dont think! Follow protocols. Thats all there is. You have trained long for this! Deep Space Exploration. Leaving all folks behind.  
This has always been your deepest dream. Reaching out new frontieers in human knowledge.
